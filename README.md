# La Corona Negra

**Each scent is a relic. Each bottle, a crown.**

La Corona Negra is a luxury perfume house curated under **Nernyx Corp** â€” a company born during the final lunar eclipse of the 20th century, with ateliers in Chalatenango, El Salvador and Ogden, Utah, USA. We craft each fragrance as if it were the final word weâ€™ll ever speak â€” layered, eternal, and unforgettable.
